Problem 5:  Useful Clock Skew Scheduling
Modern ICs span many pipeline stages whose path delays naturally vary. Enforcing zero clock skew everywhere can strand positive slack on one stage while creating negative slack on an adjacent one. Useful clock skew treats clock arrival times as optimization variables: by intentionally advancing or delaying local clocks—while honoring hold-time and implementation bounds—we can borrow slack across registers and maximize the minimum setup slack, all without moving logic across flops (thus avoiding formal-equivalence headaches). As a result, clock skew scheduling is both a must-have capability in contemporary physical design flows and a rich algorithmic problem that blends graph theory, static timing, and numerical optimization.
