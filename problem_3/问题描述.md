Problem 3:  Efficient Expressions Evaluation
In complex Virtuoso IC design flow, there are thousands of circuit and model parameters and complex expressions in the design. To simulate the circuit, the expression evaluation is normally time-consuming. And in most cases, these circuit and model parameters have dependencies on each other, making the expression evaluation even more complex. Meanwhile, in many situations, it is necessary to re-evaluate all the expressions by changing only very few parameters. There is a good opportunity for EDA tools to efficiently do expression evaluation without wasted expression calculation and accuracy loss. 

For example, the value of variable B has a dependency to variable A. And users will need to take the value of variable A into account of variable B when evaluating variable B. This is a very common usage in the circuit design / simulations, like this simple case:

A = var1 + 2; 

B = A/2; 

C = B>1.0 ? var1 : A; 

EDA tool needs an efficient way to calculate them in an optimized order, to get the correct result without duplicated/wasted calculations.
